# Project Title: Basic Calculator

Project Overview:
This project is a simple calculator application designed to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, exponentiation, shows trigonometric function value, shows constant values and can calculate the area. It is intended to help users perform quick calculations.

Features:
- Addition: Allows the user to add two numbers.
- Subtraction: Allows the user to subtract one number from another.
- Multiplication: Allows the user to multiply two numbers.
- Division: Allows the user to divide one number by another.
- Modulus: Allows the user to get the modulus by division of dividend by divisor.
- Exponentiation: Allows the user to calculate the exponentiation.
- Trigonometric function: Allows the user to quick find the sin, cos and tan of popular degrees.
- Constant: Allows the user to access the 'e' and 'Ï€' values.
- Area: Allows the user to calculate the area of 'circle', 'square', 'rectangle' and 'triangle'.
- Clear Button: Clears the input and result fields.
- Error Handling: Displays error messages when invalid operations, like division by zero, are attempted.

Technologies Used:
- Programming Language: Python

How to Run:
1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your computer.
2. Download or clone the project from the repository.
3. Open the command line/terminal and navigate to the project folder.
4. Run the command: `python calculator.py`
5. The graphical calculator interface will open, and you can start using it.

Challenges Faced:
- Writing with object oriented was a bit tricky.

Future Improvements:
- Implementing more advanced mathematical functions such as square roots, more area calculators , volume of geometric shapes, logarithm.
- Adding a memory feature to store previous calculations.
- Improving the user interface with additional styling or a dark mode.
